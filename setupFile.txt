This is tha analytical tool which reads the file and provides the analytical results.

Pre-requites
Go 1.16
VSCode 1.56
Go plugins 

Build this tool
Navigate to root folder
RUN "go mod download" --> to download dependencies
RUN "go build -o main ." --> to build the code and create binary

Run this tool
Since this tool uses some custom inputs for queries
Below Env variables are used to custom the queries
MATCH_BY_NAME="<queries recipes based on names separated by space>" eg ["Apple Pizza"]
QUERY_POSTCODE="<queries delivery count based on postcode>" eg "10001"
QUERY_DELIVERY_TIME="<queries delivery count based on time>" eg "7AM - 10PM"
FILE="<filename>" eg test_data.json

You can run this tool with or without docker

Without Docker
1. First set these env variables described above
2. RUN "./main  <location to filename>" eg "~/data.json" [env variable FILE can also be used to set file to run]

With Docker
The json files we want to run has to be in working directory
else it would not be able to access that from container
RUN "docker build -t recipe-app ." --> this would create image of this cli
RUN docker run --env FILE="<filename>" --env QUERY_DELIVERY_TIME="<query delivery name in format '3AM - 12PM'>" --env QUERY_POSTCODE="<query postcode>" --env MATCH_BY_NAME="query to match by name separated by space" recipe-app

Eg for passing env variables
docker run --env FILE="test_data.json" --env QUERY_DELIVERY_TIME="12AM - 10PM" --env QUERY_POSTCODE="10001" --env MATCH_BY_NAME="Apple" recipe-app

Note 
1. QUERY_POSTCODE and QUERY_DELIVERY_TIME need to be used together to query delivery count per postcode and time
2. If using file name as command args, then env variable FILE wont be used as command would get more precedence over env
3. By default MATCH_BY_NAME = "Potato Veggie Mushroom"
4. By default QUERY_POSTCODE="10120" and QUERY_DELIVERY_TIME="10AM - 3PM"
